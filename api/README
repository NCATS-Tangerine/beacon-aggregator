This folder contains the Swagger / OpenAPI specifications used on the client and server side of the Beacon Aggregator.

The back end Knowledge Beacon APIs wrap knowledge sources polled by the aggregator, 
the current Swagger 2.0 specification for which is in the 'knowledge-beacon-api' files (yaml and json).

The front end Aggregator server interface provides a similar but distinct API, the Swagger 2.0
version for which is specified in the 'knowledge-beacon-api' files (yaml and json).

A "next generation" specification is being pondered for the Knowledge Beacons, but currently 
on the backburner. The current iteration of this version (to use OpenAPI 3.0 and be registered 
as a SmartAPI) is documented in the knowledge-beacon-api-2.2.0 files (yaml and json).
