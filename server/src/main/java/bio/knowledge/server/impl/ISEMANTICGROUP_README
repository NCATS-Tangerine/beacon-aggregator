Some Beacon and Server classes have an impedence mismatch of methods relating to 'semanticGroup' properties.
The ISemanticGroup adds these methods using the Java 8 'default' directive in the interface, along with 
abstract declarations of the corresponding 'type' setter/getter methods.

Note that Code Generation likely deletes the interface association of 'implements ISemanticGroup' so this needs to be
patched in each time (at least, until which day that the Beacon API is harmonized with the Beacon Aggregator API)

This seems to be the least intrusive way to fix the problem but unfortunately, this has the side effect of
exposing the 'semanticGroup' attribute in the corresponding output JSON (which TKBIO and other clients can simply ignore?)
